      <description>Since high school I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with programming and all things IT. I was fortunate to have some great teachers that taught me a lot of basics. I learned how to program first in Turbo Pascal, later Delphi. I learned about Turing machines and databases (SQL).
I ended up studying chemistry, but the computational chemistry courses introduced me to python which I started using for all kinds of tasks. I also learned some LaTeX and wrote my Master&amp;rsquo;s as well as PhD thesis in LaTex.</description>
