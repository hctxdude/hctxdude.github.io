      <p>Since high school I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with programming and all things IT. I was fortunate to have some great teachers that taught me a lot of basics. I learned how to program first in Turbo Pascal, later Delphi. I learned about Turing machines and databases (SQL).</p>

<p>I ended up studying chemistry, but the computational chemistry courses introduced me to python which I started using for all kinds of tasks. I also learned some LaTeX and wrote my Master&rsquo;s as well as PhD thesis in LaTex.</p>

<p>I kept writing little python scripts here and there for menial tasks.</p>

<p>After my PhD I had a spent a short amount of time as a lab chemist before switching into a sales role. In that role I began to apply my programming skills again. I got access to our sales data which I was able to mine for valuable information. I learned how to use R for this and the amazing Shiny package enabled me to build a complete dashboard fairly quickly.
The dashboard is able to do the following things:
- observe trends over weeks, quarters and years as well as sales territory and individual states
- extract customer data
- identify dead accounts
- identify new accounts
- create quick overview of geographically close accounts
- analyse single accounts
- analyse sales channel trends
- analyse product sales / popularity
- use tables and graphs (TODO) to achieve all the above</p>

<p>I mostly used the tidyverse package. Initially purely out of convenience. Later I learned about data.table, but apart from the initial reading in of the data, I found it to be quite a bit slower than the tidyverse operations, which seems to be the opposite of the general trend. In any case, the dashboard works and fulfills its purpose very well.</p>

<p>Another one of my side projects has been to create custom lists of products for my customers. I&rsquo;ve been offering customers an overview of chemicals that is specific to their needs to save them the time and effort to look through pages of search results. I&rsquo;ve been able to do that by utilizing python scripts to extract product codes from search results and then to generate a html page with customized categories and tables containing the structure, bottle sizes and cost (adjusted to their respective discounts). The page is then converted to a PDF file that I can either print out or send directly to the customer.</p>

<p>My next side project is working through the book &ldquo;How to design programs 2nd Edition&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;ve always been intrigued by functional programming. The idea of same input -&gt; same output makes a lot of sense, modularity makes code easier to read and revise
I&rsquo;m working my way through How To Design Programs 2 to learn from the ground up how to properly use the functional programming paradigm. I&rsquo;m already familiar with R and have come to like the use of map() instead of for loops as well as piping functions into functions. I expect this book to help me build the skills to use the proper tools for every problem, adhere to proper coding conventions and make my work more logical and readable for third parties.</p>
